Need to make design of each room more interesting with mazing paths and different enemy layouts
need to add faster progression by using secrets/knowledge gained from previous playthroughs

random ideas
  secret tunnel to unlock speed early (should have as many sequence breaks from knowledge gained from previous playthroughs as possible)
